# 03.R Practice 

This game developer's making a Choose Your Own Adventure game but they're having a problem: they don't know how to save HTML elements in variables. Therefore, certain parts of the game won't show up when the user clicks! 

Help them save the different HTML elements in variables! When you're done the game should work like [this](https://maxwilliams361.github.io/03R-Practice-SOLUTION-CODE-FINAL)

## Code Along Part 1

If you notice, parts of the story have been hidden in CSS. Let's take a quick look at lines 1-7 of the CSS. 

When the user clicks the "Open the box" button, I want the part of the story saved in the `option-one-div` to show up. To do that we first need to save these parts of the story in variables. Can someone take me through the steps to do that?

## Code It Solo Part 1
Now do the following to save the second button and second option of the story:
1. Declare a variable to save the button with the class of `option-two`.   
2. Declare a variable to save the button with the class `option-two-screen`.


STOP HERE!

## Code Along Part 2
Let's use the console to check our variables saved correctly. Watch as I use `console.log()` to check the contents of our first variable. 

## Code It Solo
Now use `console.log()` to check the contents of the two variables you created. Did they save correctly? If not, fix them!

## Let's use our variables!

Scroll down in your JavaScript section to find the code that's been commented out.

Together, let's plug in the variables we created to make it so that parts of the story show up when the user clicks the button!  

Uncomment the code, try it out on the webpage, and see what happens!
